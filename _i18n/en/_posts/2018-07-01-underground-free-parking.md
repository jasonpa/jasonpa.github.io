We have 1.5 hours free underground parking. Parking for all patrons on the P1 level of the parkade will be free for the first 90 minutes, but will require vehicle registration at the various metres installed around the site, or by using Impark’s Hangtag App. Pay parking will be in effect for any parker’s who require to park for longer than 90 minutes.

It's all connected to Thrifty food store parkade. You can come up directly from P1(Liquor store parking area) with elevator. [Directions](https://goo.gl/maps/54ozHXfEGis)
