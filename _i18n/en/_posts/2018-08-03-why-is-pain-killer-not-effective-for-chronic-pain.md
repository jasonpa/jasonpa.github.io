## Overview

As you can see this article 
[There's a chronic pain crisis in Canada, and governments must address it](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-theres-a-chronic-pain-crisis-in-canada-and-governments-must-address/), chronic pain affects one in every five Canadians, or six million of us. It's a lot. 

Unlike acute pain, chronic pain is characterized by the inability to be solved by taking painkillers. NSAIDS, the most commonly used pain reliever in hospitals, is a medicine that works only for acute pain by inhibiting the enzyme that produces the painful substance to block the last state of inflammation and thereby relieve pain. It is meaningless to prescribe analgesics after the pain has already disappeared in the area where the tissue damage has been occurring for more than a month. Therefore, in the case of chronic pain, the pain medication is ineffective, but it is a reality that it is continuously prescribed. It is not effective and long-term use for more than 10 days increases the risk of cerebral infarction or myocardial infarction. 

## How is chronic pain classified? 

Particularly when the pain is chronic, the response of the nervous system to the acute pain is affected by various factors including mental or social.

Chronic pain is usually chronic nociceptive pain in which the pain signal continues in an injured tissue, and chronic neuropathic pain, which is no longer harmful but continues to be excited by pain conduction.

It can also be categorized as chronic psychogenic pain, which is disturbed by the circuit that erases the pain memory for psychological reasons.

However, chronic pain is not exactly divided into these categories. In most cases, 2-3 kinds of pain are entangled to reveal complex patterns.

In other words, chronic pain is not a simple scheme that suffers from peripheral stimuli such as acute pain, but the pain changes in the spinal cord and brain, causing the pain to increase or change the way you feel the pain. To be more precise, the patient himself is making new pain in the spinal cord or brain, or healing the existing pain.

For example, appromimately 60-80% of individuals with an amputation experience phantom sensations in their amputated limb, and the majority of the sensations are painful. [^1]. This is the well-known case in nowadays. 

## Treatment of chronic pain with Herbal medicine
In herbal medicine, most prescriptions lead to both physical and mental reactions. In other words, it works both on the body and on the mind. You can expect the spinal cord and brain to act to erase the deformed pain.

By taking herbal medicine, various systems such as inflammation of the body, microcirculation, moisture distribution, heat production including psychological state can be restored to normal and the result can be the pain disappearing.

In the case of acute pain, treatment with herbal medicine increases effectiveness.

Do not let any kind of pain, such as back pain, arthralgia, arthritis, rheumatism, shoulder pain, etc., become chronic, and choose a wise healing method after diagnosis.
