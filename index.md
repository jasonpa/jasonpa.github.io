It improves health and stimulates the body’s natural healing mechanisms by stimulating acupressure points/meridians using a fine, sterile needle. Pressure, heat, or electrical stimulation may further enhance the effects. You do not need a physician’s referral to attend acupuncture sessions. ICBC allows Acupuncturists in BC to directly bill for treatments provided to patients who have sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident. Some extended health plans may cover the cost of the treatment as well. Please review your private insurance plan for more details."
