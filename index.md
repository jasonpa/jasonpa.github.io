    #excerpt: "The purpose of Herbal Medicine or TEM(Traditional Eastern Medicine), TCM(Traditional Chinese Medicine) is to recover the natural balance of your body.

    title: "Acupuncture"
    #excerpt: "Our integrated approach incorporates both research-based and time-tested treatments combining Chinese medicine, acupuncture, acupoint-injection and functional medicine. Rather than taking a traditional disease-centred focus, we address the underlying causes of disease using a patient-centred approach addressing the whole person, not just an isolated set of symptoms."
    excerpt: "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practices draw from holistic Eastern healing techniques. Acupuncture is the most common technique used. It improves health and stimulates the body’s natural healing mechanisms by stimulating acupressure points/meridians using a fine, sterile needle. Pressure, heat, or electrical stimulation may further enhance the effects. You do not need a physician’s referral to attend acupuncture sessions. ICBC allows Acupuncturists in BC to directly bill for treatments provided to patients who have sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident. Some extended health plans may cover the cost of the treatment as well. Please review your private insurance plan for more details."
