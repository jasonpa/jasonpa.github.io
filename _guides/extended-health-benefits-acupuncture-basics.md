Most extended health plans in Canada include coverage for acupuncture, but many people don't realize they have this benefit or aren't sure how to use it. This guide explains the basics of using your extended health benefits for acupuncture at Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver.

## What extended health benefits typically cover

**Annual limits**: Most plans cover $300-$1000 per year for acupuncture. Some plans have per-visit limits (e.g., $50-$80 per session), while others have only an annual cap.

**Registered practitioners**: Coverage usually requires treatment by a registered acupuncturist (R.Ac or R.TCM.P). Ryu Clinic practitioners are fully registered and qualified.

**Receipts**: You'll need official receipts showing the practitioner's registration number, date of service, and amount paid.

**Referrals**: Most plans don't require a doctor's referral for acupuncture, but check your specific policy.

## How to check your coverage

**Review your benefits booklet**: Look for "Acupuncture," "Traditional Chinese Medicine," or "Complementary/Alternative Therapies."

**Call your insurer**: Have your policy number ready and ask:
- How much acupuncture coverage do I have per year?
- Is there a per-visit limit?
- Do I need a referral?
- Can I submit claims online?

**Ask your HR department**: They can clarify your specific plan details.

## Using your benefits at Ryu Clinic

**Direct billing**: Check if Ryu Clinic offers direct billing for your insurer. This means you don't pay upfront—the clinic bills your insurance directly.

**Pay and submit**: If direct billing isn't available, you pay at the time of service and submit receipts to your insurer for reimbursement.

**Receipts**: Ryu Clinic provides detailed receipts with all necessary information for insurance claims.

**Tracking**: Keep track of how many sessions you've used and how much coverage remains.

## Maximizing your benefits

**Use it or lose it**: Most benefits don't roll over to the next year, so use your full allocation.

**Family plans**: If you have family coverage, each family member may have their own allocation.

**Combine with other benefits**: Some plans allow you to use acupuncture benefits in addition to physiotherapy, massage, or chiropractic coverage.

**Year-end planning**: Book sessions in November-December to use remaining benefits before they reset in January.

You can book online through JaneApp or call Ryu Clinic to discuss your extended health benefits and ensure you're making the most of your coverage.
