While Ryu Clinic has a strong local presence in Coquitlam and the Tri-Cities, many patients travel from Vancouver, Burnaby, Surrey, and other parts of the Lower Mainland for treatment. Here's what makes the journey worthwhile.

## Bilingual care (English and Korean)

For Korean-speaking patients across the Lower Mainland, finding a qualified acupuncturist who can communicate fluently in Korean makes a significant difference. Being able to discuss symptoms, concerns, and treatment plans in your preferred language ensures nothing is lost in translation and helps you feel more comfortable and understood.

This is particularly important when discussing sensitive health issues, explaining complex symptoms, or understanding treatment recommendations. At Ryu Clinic, consultations can be conducted entirely in Korean if preferred.

## Multidisciplinary environment

Both Ryu Clinic locations (Momentum Therapeutics in Coquitlam and Regen Recovery in Vancouver) operate within multidisciplinary facilities. This means:

**Coordinated care**: If you need physiotherapy, massage, or other services in addition to acupuncture, everything is available in one location.

**Team communication**: Your acupuncturist can easily coordinate with your physiotherapist, massage therapist, or other providers to ensure everyone is working toward the same goals.

**Convenience**: Multiple appointments in one trip saves time and makes it easier to stick with your treatment plan.

## ICBC expertise

Ryu Clinic has extensive experience working with ICBC claims and understands the unique needs of car accident recovery. This includes:

- Familiarity with ICBC billing and documentation requirements
- Understanding of typical accident injury patterns and recovery timelines
- Ability to coordinate with other ICBC-approved providers
- Clear communication about treatment plans and progress

For patients dealing with the stress and complexity of ICBC claims, working with a clinic that knows the system inside and out makes the process much smoother.

## Personalized, patient-centered approach

Every patient is different, and treatment at Ryu Clinic reflects that. Rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach, your practitioner takes time to:

- Understand your specific symptoms, health history, and goals
- Explain what's happening in your body and why certain treatments are recommended
- Adjust treatment based on how you respond
- Educate you about self-care strategies that support your recovery

Patients often mention that they feel heard, respected, and actively involved in their care—not just treated as another appointment on the schedule.

## Flexible scheduling

With two locations and extended hours (including evenings and weekends), Ryu Clinic makes it easier to fit treatment into a busy schedule. Online booking through JaneApp adds convenience, and the clinic works to accommodate patients who are traveling from farther away by offering back-to-back appointments or coordinating with other services.

## Quality of care

Ultimately, patients are willing to travel because they get results. Whether it's relief from chronic pain, faster recovery from an injury, better stress management, or improved overall health, the quality of care makes the drive worthwhile.

## Is it worth the drive for you?

If you're in Vancouver, Burnaby, Surrey, or elsewhere in the Lower Mainland and considering Ryu Clinic, ask yourself:

- Do I value bilingual (Korean/English) care?
- Would I benefit from multidisciplinary treatment options in one location?
- Am I looking for a practitioner who takes time to understand my specific situation?
- Do I have ICBC or extended health benefits that make the investment worthwhile?

If the answer to any of these is yes, the drive to Coquitlam or the Vancouver location might be exactly what you need.

You can book online through JaneApp or call to discuss whether Ryu Clinic is the right fit for your needs, regardless of where you're coming from in the Lower Mainland.
