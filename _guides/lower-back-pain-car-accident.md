Lower back pain is one of the most common injuries after a car accident, and it can significantly impact your ability to work, drive, and perform daily activities. The forces involved in a collision—even a low-speed one—can strain muscles, ligaments, and joints in your lumbar spine, leading to pain that ranges from mild discomfort to severe, debilitating ache. If you're dealing with lower back pain after a car accident in Coquitlam or Vancouver, acupuncture can be an effective part of your ICBC recovery plan.

## Common causes of lower back pain after accidents

**Lumbar strain**: The sudden impact of a collision can overstretch or tear the muscles and ligaments that support your lower back. This is similar to a sprain in your ankle, but it affects the soft tissues around your spine. The pain is usually localized to one side or across the lower back, and it worsens with movement, bending, or prolonged sitting.

**Facet joint inflammation**: The small joints between your vertebrae (facet joints) can become inflamed or irritated during an accident. This causes deep, aching pain that's often worse in the morning or after periods of inactivity.

**Sacroiliac joint dysfunction**: The sacroiliac (SI) joints connect your pelvis to your spine, and they can be jarred or misaligned during a collision. SI joint pain is typically felt in the lower back, buttocks, or hips, and it may radiate down one leg.

**Disc injury**: In more severe accidents, the intervertebral discs can be damaged—either bulging, herniated, or torn. This can cause sharp pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness that radiates down one or both legs (sciatica).

**Muscle spasm**: After an injury, your back muscles often go into protective spasm, which can be extremely painful and limit your ability to move. These spasms can persist for days or weeks if not properly treated.

## How acupuncture helps lower back pain

Acupuncture addresses lower back pain on multiple levels:

**Pain relief**: Acupuncture stimulates the release of endorphins and other natural pain-relieving chemicals, reducing pain intensity and improving your ability to move and function.

**Inflammation reduction**: By calming the inflammatory response in injured tissues, acupuncture helps reduce swelling, stiffness, and pain in the acute phase of recovery.

**Muscle relaxation**: Acupuncture releases muscle spasms and trigger points, allowing your back muscles to relax and reducing the protective guarding that contributes to ongoing pain.

**Improved circulation**: Better blood flow to the injured area supports tissue healing and helps clear away inflammatory byproducts.

**Nervous system regulation**: Acupuncture helps calm an overactive nervous system, which can reduce pain sensitivity and improve sleep—both critical for recovery.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, treatment for lower back pain after a car accident is tailored to your specific injury pattern. If you're dealing with acute muscle strain, the focus will be on reducing inflammation and releasing muscle tension. If SI joint dysfunction or facet joint pain is involved, treatment will address joint mobility and surrounding soft tissues.

## Combining with other therapies

Lower back pain often responds best to a combination of treatments:

**Physiotherapy**: Helps restore core strength, improve posture, and teach you safe movement patterns. Acupuncture can reduce pain and muscle guarding, making physio exercises more tolerable.

**Chiropractic**: Addresses joint alignment and mobility. Acupuncture before chiropractic adjustments can help relax muscles and make adjustments more effective.

**Massage**: Releases superficial muscle tension and improves circulation. Acupuncture addresses deeper trigger points and nerve-related pain.

Because Ryu Clinic operates within multidisciplinary facilities (Momentum Therapeutics in Coquitlam and Regen Recovery in Vancouver), coordinating these therapies is straightforward.

## Recovery timeline

**Weeks 1-2**: Focus on pain reduction and inflammation control. Acupuncture 2x per week.

**Weeks 3-6**: Restore movement and reduce muscle spasm. Acupuncture 1-2x per week, combined with gentle exercises.

**Weeks 6-12**: Build strength and prevent recurrence. Acupuncture every 1-2 weeks as needed.

Most people see significant improvement within 6-8 weeks with consistent treatment. ICBC typically covers acupuncture as part of your accident claim—bring your claim number and accident date to your first visit.

You can book online through JaneApp or call Ryu Clinic to discuss your lower back pain and create a personalized recovery plan.
