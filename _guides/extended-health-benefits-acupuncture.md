## What most extended health plans cover for acupuncture

- Typical structure: yearly dollar maximum vs per-visit maximum.[web:19]
- Common insurers in BC: Pacific Blue Cross, Sun Life, Canada Life, Manulife (examples, not an exhaustive list).
- What “acupuncturist” coverage usually means vs “TCM practitioner” or “RMT”.
- How unused benefits often do not roll over to the next year.

### Questions to ask your insurer or HR

- What is my annual limit for acupuncture?
- Is there a per-visit maximum amount?
- Do I need a doctor’s note or referral?
- Is direct billing available, or do I submit receipts myself?

## Visit limits, yearly maximums and how they work

- Example: $500/year for acupuncture vs combined paramedical maximum.
- How co-pay or partial coverage may appear on your claim.
- Differences between individual and family plans.
- How splitting visits across multiple clinics may affect your remaining balance.

### Common misunderstandings

- Thinking benefits cover “unlimited” sessions when there is a clear maximum.
- Assuming you can “save” unused benefits for the next year.
- Confusing medical insurance (MSP) with extended health benefits.

## Direct billing vs self-submit

- What direct billing is and how it simplifies your visit.[web:16][web:22]
- When direct billing may not be available (e.g. certain plans or insurers).
- Self-submit basics: downloading your insurer’s app or portal, uploading receipts.
- How Ryu Clinic prepares receipts with all required information.

### What to bring to your first visit

- Insurance card or policy information.
- Any reference number your insurer uses for you or your family.
- Photo ID and contact information for your plan holder (if not you).

## How Ryu Clinic works with your benefits

- Checking coverage details you provide and aligning your treatment plan with your limits.[web:16][web:37]
- Planning frequency: more frequent early visits vs spaced maintenance sessions later in the year.
- Discussing options openly if you are close to your yearly maximum.
- Combining extended benefits with ICBC or other coverage where applicable.

## Using benefits across the year

- Phase 1: early-year assessment and addressing known issues.
- Phase 2: mid-year tune-up and managing work or training stress.
- Phase 3: year-end check-up and planning for the upcoming year.[web:44]
- Example: using monthly or every-2–3-week visits instead of a last-minute rush in December.

### Building a personal benefits strategy

- Prioritising your main issue (neck, back, headaches, stress, etc.).
- Deciding how much of your yearly allowance to reserve for flare-ups.
- Coordinating with other therapies (physio, massage, counselling) within one plan.
