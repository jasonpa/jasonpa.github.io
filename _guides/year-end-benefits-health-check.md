Most extended health benefits reset on January 1st, which means any unused coverage from the current year disappears. If you haven't used your full allocation of acupuncture benefits, November and December are the time to act. Here's how to make the most of your year-end benefits at Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver.

## Check your remaining coverage

**Review your benefits statement**: Most insurers provide online portals where you can see how much coverage you've used and how much remains.

**Call your insurer**: If you're not sure, call with your policy number and ask how much acupuncture coverage you have left for the year.

**Check family members**: Don't forget to check coverage for your spouse and children—they each have their own allocation.

**Typical allocations**: Most plans provide $300-$1000 per person per year for acupuncture.

## Smart ways to use remaining benefits

**Address lingering issues**: That nagging shoulder tension, occasional headaches, or lower back stiffness you've been ignoring? Now's the time to address it.

**Preventive care**: Even if you feel fine, acupuncture can support immune function heading into cold and flu season, reduce stress before the holidays, and set you up for a healthy start to the new year.

**Maintenance sessions**: If you've had acupuncture before and felt better, a few maintenance sessions can help you stay ahead of problems.

**Try it for the first time**: If you've been curious about acupuncture but haven't tried it, use your benefits to explore it risk-free.

**Prepare for known stressors**: If you know the holidays, year-end work deadlines, or winter weather trigger pain or stress, proactive treatment can help you manage better.

## Booking strategy for year-end

**Book early**: December fills up quickly as many people try to use their benefits. Book now to secure your preferred times.

**Multiple sessions**: If you have significant coverage remaining, consider booking 2-4 sessions in November-December.

**Family coordination**: Schedule multiple family members on the same day to save time.

**Flexible scheduling**: Ryu Clinic offers evening and weekend appointments to accommodate busy year-end schedules.

## What to focus on

**Stress management**: The holidays can be stressful. Acupuncture helps calm your nervous system and improve resilience.

**Immune support**: Heading into cold and flu season, acupuncture can support immune function.

**Pain prevention**: Address minor aches before they become major problems in the new year.

**Sleep quality**: Better sleep supports everything else—mood, energy, immune function, and pain management.

**Injury recovery**: If you've been dealing with a sports injury, car accident recovery, or chronic pain, use remaining benefits to continue treatment.

## Planning for next year

**Set up maintenance**: If acupuncture has helped you, consider scheduling monthly maintenance sessions for the new year to stay ahead of problems.

**Track your benefits**: Keep a record of your annual allocation so you can plan strategically throughout the year.

**Don't wait until December**: Spread your benefits throughout the year for better results rather than cramming everything into the last month.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, we see a surge of patients in November and December who are making smart use of their year-end benefits. Don't let your coverage go to waste—book online through JaneApp or call to schedule your year-end health check and start the new year feeling your best.
