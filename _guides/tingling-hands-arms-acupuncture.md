Tingling, numbness, or "pins and needles" sensations in your hands and arms can be annoying at best and alarming at worst. These symptoms often indicate nerve compression or irritation somewhere along the pathway from your neck to your fingertips. While some causes require medical evaluation, many cases respond well to acupuncture, especially when combined with posture correction and ergonomic adjustments.

## Common causes of tingling hands and arms

**Carpal tunnel syndrome**: Compression of the median nerve as it passes through the wrist. Symptoms include tingling, numbness, and pain in the thumb, index, middle, and part of the ring finger. Often worse at night or after repetitive hand use.

**Cervical nerve compression**: Nerve roots exiting the cervical spine can be compressed by herniated discs, bone spurs, or muscle tension. This causes tingling, numbness, or pain that radiates from the neck down the arm into the hand.

**Thoracic outlet syndrome**: Compression of nerves and blood vessels between the collarbone and first rib. Causes tingling, numbness, and weakness in the arm and hand, often triggered by overhead activities or certain arm positions.

**Cubital tunnel syndrome**: Compression of the ulnar nerve at the elbow. Causes tingling in the ring and pinky fingers, often worse when the elbow is bent for long periods (like holding a phone).

**Repetitive strain**: Prolonged typing, mouse use, or other repetitive hand movements can irritate nerves and cause tingling.

**Poor posture**: Forward head posture and rounded shoulders can compress nerves in the neck and upper chest, leading to arm and hand symptoms.

## When to see a doctor

**Seek medical attention if you experience**:
- Sudden onset of severe numbness or weakness
- Loss of bladder or bowel control
- Numbness on both sides of the body
- Symptoms after a head or neck injury
- Progressive worsening despite conservative treatment
- Muscle wasting in the hand or arm

These could indicate serious conditions that require urgent evaluation.

## How acupuncture helps nerve-related tingling

**Reduces inflammation**: Inflammation around nerves contributes to compression and irritation. Acupuncture has anti-inflammatory effects that can help calm this response.

**Releases muscle tension**: Tight muscles in the neck, shoulder, forearm, or wrist can compress nerves. Acupuncture releases these muscles, reducing pressure on nerve pathways.

**Improves circulation**: Better blood flow supports nerve health and healing.

**Modulates nerve signals**: Acupuncture can help normalize nerve function and reduce abnormal sensations like tingling and numbness.

**Addresses root causes**: If poor posture or repetitive strain is contributing to your symptoms, acupuncture can be combined with ergonomic adjustments and exercises to address the underlying problem.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, treatment for tingling hands and arms includes assessment of your posture, work setup, and movement patterns to identify and address contributing factors.

## Self-care strategies

**Ergonomic adjustments**: Ensure your workstation supports neutral wrist and arm positions. Use a keyboard and mouse that don't require excessive wrist extension or flexion.

**Frequent breaks**: Take short breaks every 20-30 minutes to stretch and change positions.

**Nerve gliding exercises**: Gentle exercises that help nerves move smoothly through their pathways can reduce symptoms. Your practitioner can teach you these.

**Posture correction**: Work on maintaining a neutral spine and avoiding forward head posture.

**Avoid prolonged pressure**: Don't lean on your elbows or rest your wrists on hard surfaces for extended periods.

**Wrist splints**: For carpal tunnel syndrome, wearing a neutral wrist splint at night can help reduce symptoms.
