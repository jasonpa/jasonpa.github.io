After a car accident, it's common to feel relatively okay in the first few hours or even the first few days. The adrenaline is still flowing, you're focused on dealing with insurance and vehicle repairs, and you might think you escaped without serious injury. Then, a few days or weeks later, the pain sets in—stiffness in your neck, aching in your lower back, headaches, or shoulder tension that wasn't there before. This delayed onset of pain is extremely common after motor vehicle accidents, and understanding why it happens can help you take the right steps to recover.

## Why pain doesn't always show up right away

Immediately after a collision, your body goes into survival mode. Adrenaline and cortisol flood your system, temporarily masking pain and allowing you to function despite underlying tissue damage. This is your body's natural protective response, and it's why many people walk away from an accident feeling shaken but not necessarily hurt.

As the adrenaline wears off over the next 24 to 72 hours, the pain signals that were suppressed start to come through. At the same time, inflammation begins to build in the injured tissues. Muscles, ligaments, and fascia that were stretched, strained, or torn during the impact start to swell, stiffen, and become painful as the inflammatory response kicks in.

**Muscle guarding** is another factor. After an accident, your muscles tense up to protect injured areas, and this protective tension can persist for days or weeks. As the muscles stay contracted, they become fatigued, develop trigger points, and start to ache. What began as a protective response becomes a source of pain itself.

**Delayed inflammation** in joints and soft tissues can take several days to fully develop. Whiplash injuries, for example, often don't reach peak pain until two to three days after the accident. The forces involved in a collision can cause micro-tears in ligaments and muscles that don't become symptomatic until swelling and stiffness set in.

**Nervous system sensitization** can also contribute to delayed pain. The trauma of the accident can leave your nervous system in a heightened state, making you more sensitive to pain signals. Over the days and weeks following the accident, this sensitization can amplify discomfort that might have been minor at first.

## Common patterns of delayed pain

**Neck pain and stiffness** are among the most common delayed symptoms after a car accident. You might wake up a few days after the collision with a stiff neck, difficulty turning your head, or a heavy, achy feeling at the base of your skull. This is often a sign of whiplash, even if the accident seemed minor at the time.

**Headaches** can develop days or even weeks after an accident. They might start as mild tension headaches and gradually worsen, or they might appear suddenly as throbbing pain at the base of the skull, temples, or forehead. These headaches are often related to neck muscle tension, nerve irritation, or changes in blood flow following the injury.

**Lower back pain** may not be noticeable immediately, especially if you were focused on neck or shoulder discomfort. As the initial shock wears off, you might start to feel aching, stiffness, or sharp pain in your lower back, particularly when sitting, standing, or bending.

**Shoulder and upper back pain** can develop as muscles in the upper body compensate for neck injuries or as seatbelt-related strain becomes apparent. The pain might be localized to one shoulder or spread across the upper back.

**Fatigue and sleep disturbances** often accompany delayed pain. You might feel more tired than usual, have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep, or wake up feeling unrested. This is partly due to pain and partly due to the stress and nervous system activation that follow a traumatic event.

## Why you shouldn't ignore delayed pain

It's tempting to hope that delayed pain will resolve on its own, especially if it starts out mild. But ignoring these symptoms can lead to chronic problems that are much harder to treat later.

When pain is left untreated in the first few weeks after an accident, several things can happen:

**Muscle tension becomes chronic**: Protective muscle guarding that was initially helpful can turn into long-term tightness and trigger points. These chronic patterns are harder to release once they've been in place for months.

**Scar tissue forms**: As injured tissues heal without proper treatment, scar tissue can develop in ways that restrict movement and create ongoing stiffness and pain.

**Nervous system sensitization deepens**: If your nervous system stays in a heightened pain state for weeks or months, it can become "trained" to perceive pain more intensely, even after the original injury has healed. This is how acute pain can transition into chronic pain.

**Compensation patterns develop**: When one area hurts, your body compensates by changing how you move. Over time, these compensations can create new problems in other areas—for example, favoring one side can lead to hip or knee pain.

The good news is that early intervention can interrupt these patterns before they become entrenched. Getting assessed and starting treatment within the first few weeks after an accident gives you the best chance of a full, uncomplicated recovery.

## When and how to start treatment

If you're experiencing delayed pain after a car accident, the first step is to get a proper assessment. Even if your pain seems mild, it's worth having a healthcare provider evaluate what's going on and create a treatment plan.

**When to seek care**:
- As soon as you notice pain, stiffness, or other symptoms, even if they seem minor
- Within the first two weeks after the accident if possible
- Immediately if you develop severe headaches, vision changes, numbness, weakness, or loss of bladder/bowel control (these are red flags that require urgent medical attention)

**What to bring to your first visit**:
- Your ICBC claim number
- The date of the accident
- Any medical records or imaging reports you already have
- A list of medications you're taking
- Information about other treatments you're receiving (physiotherapy, chiropractic, massage, etc.)

**How acupuncture helps with delayed pain**:

Acupuncture is particularly effective for the types of delayed pain that develop after car accidents. It works by:
- Reducing inflammation in injured tissues
- Releasing muscle tension and trigger points
- Calming an overactive nervous system
- Improving circulation to support healing
- Reducing pain signals and helping your body reset its pain threshold

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, ICBC patients are seen regularly, and the process is straightforward. Your first visit will include a detailed conversation about the accident, your current symptoms, and how they're affecting your daily life. Treatment will then focus on reducing pain, improving mobility, and preventing the transition from acute to chronic pain.

## ICBC coverage and next steps

In most cases, ICBC provides coverage for acupuncture as part of your accident claim. You typically don't need a separate doctor's referral to start treatment, though requirements can vary depending on your specific claim.

When you book your first appointment at Ryu Clinic, let them know you're coming in under an ICBC claim. Bring your claim number and accident details, and the clinic will handle the billing arrangements. You'll receive a treatment plan that outlines the recommended frequency and duration of sessions based on your symptoms and recovery goals.

Early treatment—ideally within the first few weeks after the accident—gives you the best chance of avoiding chronic pain and getting back to your normal activities quickly. Even if you feel like your symptoms are manageable right now, addressing them early can prevent much bigger problems down the road.

You can book online through JaneApp for either the Coquitlam or Vancouver location, or call the clinic to discuss your situation before scheduling. The goal is simple: catch delayed pain early, treat it effectively, and help you recover fully so you can move forward with confidence.
