If you drive for a living or have a long commute in the Greater Vancouver area, you know how sitting in traffic can take a toll on your neck and back. The combination of prolonged sitting, vibration, poor posture, and stress creates a perfect storm for chronic pain. Acupuncture can help drivers in Coquitlam and Vancouver manage pain and stay comfortable behind the wheel.

## Why driving causes pain

**Prolonged sitting**: Sitting for hours compresses the spine, reduces circulation, and weakens core muscles.

**Vibration**: Road vibration stresses the spine and can accelerate disc degeneration.

**Poor posture**: Leaning forward to see traffic, reaching for the steering wheel, or slouching all contribute to neck and back strain.

**Stress and tension**: Traffic stress causes shoulders to creep up and muscles to tense, especially in the neck and upper back.

**Limited movement**: Unlike office workers who can stand and stretch, drivers are confined to their seats for long periods.

## Common driver pain patterns

**Lower back pain**: Dull aching or sharp pain in the lower back, worse after long drives. Often accompanied by stiffness when getting out of the car.

**Neck pain and stiffness**: Tension in the neck from holding your head in one position, checking mirrors, and dealing with traffic stress.

**Shoulder tension**: Upper trapezius muscles become tight and knotted from gripping the steering wheel and stress.

**Hip and glute pain**: Sitting compresses the hips and glutes, leading to tightness and discomfort.

**Headaches**: Tension headaches starting at the base of the skull and radiating forward.

## How acupuncture helps drivers

**Pain relief**: Reduces chronic neck and back pain without relying on medication.

**Muscle tension release**: Releases tight muscles in the neck, shoulders, back, and hips.

**Improved circulation**: Counteracts the effects of prolonged sitting on blood flow.

**Stress reduction**: Calms the nervous system, reducing the physical effects of traffic stress.

**Better sleep**: Many drivers notice improved sleep quality, which supports overall recovery.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, treatment for drivers often includes:
- Releasing tension in the neck, shoulders, and lower back
- Addressing hip and glute tightness
- Calming the nervous system to reduce stress-related tension
- Providing self-care strategies for use during and after drives

## Self-care for drivers

**Seat adjustment**: Ensure your seat supports your lower back and allows you to reach the steering wheel without leaning forward.

**Lumbar support**: Use a small cushion or rolled towel to support the natural curve of your lower back.

**Breaks**: Stop every 60-90 minutes to walk, stretch, and reset your posture.

**In-car stretches** (when safely parked):
- Shoulder rolls
- Neck side bends
- Seated spinal twists
- Hip flexor stretches (step out of the car)

**Stress management**: Deep breathing at red lights, listening to calming music, and leaving extra time for your commute can reduce tension.

**Regular acupuncture**: Weekly or bi-weekly sessions help manage chronic pain and prevent it from worsening.

You can book online through JaneApp or call Ryu Clinic to create a pain management routine that keeps you comfortable on the road.
