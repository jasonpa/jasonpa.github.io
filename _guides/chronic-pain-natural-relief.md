Living with chronic pain is exhausting. It affects your work, your sleep, your relationships, and your ability to enjoy the activities you love. If you've tried medications, physical therapy, or other treatments and still haven't found lasting relief, you're not alone—and you're not out of options. Acupuncture offers a natural, evidence-based approach to chronic pain management that addresses the root causes rather than just masking symptoms.

## What counts as chronic pain

Chronic pain is generally defined as pain that lasts for three months or longer, often persisting even after the original injury or condition has healed. Unlike acute pain, which is your body's way of signaling immediate harm, chronic pain can become a condition in itself, involving changes in your nervous system, muscles, and even your brain's pain processing pathways.

One in four Canadians lives with chronic pain, and it's one of the leading reasons people seek alternative and complementary therapies like acupuncture. Chronic pain doesn't just hurt—it drains your energy, disrupts your sleep, and can lead to anxiety, depression, and a sense of hopelessness when conventional treatments don't provide relief.

The impact on daily life is real. Simple tasks like getting out of bed, sitting through a meeting, or playing with your kids can become difficult or impossible. You might find yourself canceling plans, avoiding activities you used to enjoy, or feeling isolated because others don't understand what you're going through.

## Common types of chronic pain

**Lower back pain** is one of the most common chronic pain conditions. It can stem from muscle strain, disc problems, arthritis, or nerve irritation, and it often gets worse with prolonged sitting, standing, or physical activity. For many people, lower back pain becomes a constant companion that flares up unpredictably and limits mobility.

**Arthritis and joint pain** affect millions of people, particularly as they age. Osteoarthritis causes stiffness, swelling, and pain in the joints, most commonly in the knees, hips, hands, and spine. Rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition, can cause widespread joint pain and inflammation. Both types can make everyday movements painful and exhausting.

**Fibromyalgia** is a complex condition characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and cognitive difficulties often called "fibro fog." The pain is often described as a constant dull ache that affects multiple areas of the body, and it can be accompanied by sensitivity to touch, headaches, and digestive issues.

**Nerve pain (neuropathy)** can result from diabetes, injuries, infections, or other conditions that damage the nerves. It often feels like burning, tingling, shooting pain, or numbness, and it can be particularly difficult to treat with conventional pain medications.

**Chronic headaches and migraines** can be debilitating, affecting your ability to work, concentrate, and participate in daily life. They may be triggered by stress, hormonal changes, poor posture, or other factors, and they often resist standard pain relief methods.

## Why people choose acupuncture for chronic pain

Many people turn to acupuncture after years of trying other treatments. Here's what makes it different:

**Natural and drug-free**: Acupuncture doesn't rely on pharmaceuticals, which means no risk of dependency, no side effects from long-term medication use, and no concerns about interactions with other drugs you may be taking. For people who want to reduce or eliminate their use of pain medications, acupuncture offers a viable alternative.

**Addresses root causes**: Rather than simply blocking pain signals, acupuncture works to restore balance in your body. It improves circulation, reduces inflammation, releases tight muscles, and calms an overactive nervous system. By addressing the underlying patterns that contribute to chronic pain, acupuncture can provide lasting relief rather than temporary symptom suppression.

**Minimal side effects**: When performed by a qualified practitioner, acupuncture is extremely safe. The most common side effects are mild and temporary—slight soreness at needle sites, brief fatigue, or a feeling of deep relaxation. Serious complications are rare.

**Holistic approach**: Acupuncture treats the whole person, not just the pain. Your practitioner will consider your sleep, stress levels, diet, emotional well-being, and lifestyle factors, and treatment will be tailored to support your overall health and quality of life.

**Complementary to other therapies**: Acupuncture can be used alongside conventional medical treatments, physical therapy, massage, and other modalities. In fact, many patients find that acupuncture enhances the effectiveness of other therapies and allows them to reduce their reliance on medications.

## What to expect: pain reduction and the treatment timeline

Chronic pain didn't develop overnight, and it won't disappear overnight either. Acupuncture works cumulatively, with each session building on the last to create lasting change in your body's pain patterns.

In the first few sessions, the goal is often to reduce the intensity and frequency of your pain, improve your sleep, and help you feel more comfortable in your body. Some people notice immediate relief after their first treatment, while others experience gradual improvement over several sessions.

As treatment continues, the focus shifts to addressing the deeper patterns that sustain chronic pain—muscle imbalances, nervous system dysregulation, inflammation, and restricted movement. You may find that your pain flares less often, that you recover more quickly when it does flare, and that you're able to do more without triggering symptoms.

For most chronic pain conditions, a series of six to twelve sessions is recommended initially, with visits scheduled once or twice a week at first and then spaced out as your symptoms improve. Your practitioner will work with you to create a realistic treatment plan based on your specific condition, how long you've had the pain, and your overall health.

## Preview the practitioner: common questions about chronic pain and acupuncture

**Will acupuncture work for my specific type of pain?**  
Acupuncture has been shown to be effective for a wide range of chronic pain conditions, including lower back pain, arthritis, fibromyalgia, nerve pain, and headaches. During your first visit, your practitioner will assess your condition and discuss whether acupuncture is a good fit for your situation. If it's not, they'll help you explore other options.

**How long until I feel better?**  
It varies. Some people notice improvement within one or two sessions, while others need several weeks of consistent treatment before they experience significant relief. Chronic pain that has been present for years typically takes longer to resolve than pain that started more recently. Your practitioner will give you a realistic timeline based on your specific case.

**Can I continue my other treatments?**  
Yes. Acupuncture is safe to use alongside most conventional treatments, including medications, physical therapy, chiropractic care, and massage. In fact, many patients find that acupuncture helps them get more out of their other therapies. Always inform your practitioner about any medications or treatments you're currently using.

**Is acupuncture covered by insurance?**  
Many extended health plans in Canada include coverage for acupuncture. Check your benefits to see how many sessions are covered per year and what documentation is required. Ryu Clinic can provide receipts and any necessary paperwork for insurance claims.

**What if I'm nervous about needles?**  
It's completely normal to feel apprehensive, especially if you've never tried acupuncture before. The needles used are extremely thin—much finer than the needles used for injections—and most people are surprised by how gentle the treatment is. Your practitioner will explain everything before starting, and you're always in control. If at any point you feel uncomfortable, you can ask to pause or stop.

## Getting started in Coquitlam or Vancouver

Ryu Clinic offers chronic pain management services at two convenient locations: Momentum Therapeutics in Coquitlam and Regen Recovery in Vancouver. Both clinics provide a supportive, professional environment where your pain is taken seriously and your treatment is personalized to your needs.

You can book online through JaneApp or call the clinic to discuss your situation and ask any questions before scheduling. When you book, let them know you're dealing with chronic pain so your practitioner can allocate enough time for a thorough initial assessment.

Your first visit will include a detailed conversation about your pain history, what you've tried, what makes your pain better or worse, and what your goals are. From there, your practitioner will create a treatment plan designed to reduce your pain, improve your function, and help you reclaim the activities and quality of life that chronic pain has taken from you.

Living with chronic pain is hard, but you don't have to do it alone, and you don't have to accept it as your new normal. Acupuncture offers a natural, effective path to relief—one that respects your body, addresses the root causes of your pain, and supports your overall well-being.
