Section: Problem / Situation
After a car accident, life rarely goes back to “normal” right away. Even if imaging looks fine and your car has already been repaired, your body and nervous system may still be in shock. Many people in the Tri-Cities and Vancouver area notice neck stiffness, headaches, low back pain or trouble sleeping in the days and weeks after a crash. On top of the physical symptoms, figuring out ICBC forms, appointments and work schedules can feel overwhelming.​

Section: Why early assessment matters
The first weeks after an accident are when your body is trying to decide whether this injury will heal and fade, or become a long-term issue. If joints stay stiff, muscles remain in protective spasm and your sleep is disrupted, pain can gradually become your new baseline. An early assessment helps identify which structures were affected and what patterns are starting to build, so you do not wait until pain is severe before looking for help.​

Section: How Ryu Clinic supports ICBC patients
At Ryu Clinic, acupuncture is used as part of a structured, evidence-informed approach to post-accident recovery. Treatments focus on reducing pain, calming an overactive nervous system and improving movement in the neck, shoulders, back and hips. Because Ryu Clinic works inside Momentum Therapeutics in Coquitlam and Regen Recovery in Vancouver, patients have access to multidisciplinary environments where acupuncture can complement physiotherapy, massage and other services when needed.​

Section: ICBC coverage and what you need
If you have an active ICBC claim, you can typically begin acupuncture care without a physician referral and with pre-approved sessions covered under your claim. For your first visit, it is helpful to bring your claim number, the date of the accident, a list of current symptoms and any other treatments you are receiving. Ryu Clinic can bill ICBC directly so that you can focus on recovery rather than paperwork and payment at each visit.​

Section: How to book in Coquitlam & Vancouver
You can receive care at two locations: Momentum Therapeutics in Coquitlam and Regen Recovery in Vancouver, both accessible by transit and with on-site parking. Choose the clinic that fits best with your home or work, then book online through the JaneApp links or call the phone numbers listed on the Contact page. From your first assessment, the goal is simple: understand what the accident did to your body, reduce pain and stiffness, and help you safely return to the activities that matter most to you.​
