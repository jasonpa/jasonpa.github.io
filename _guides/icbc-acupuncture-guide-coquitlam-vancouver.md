After a car accident, it is completely normal to feel overwhelmed by symptoms, paperwork and worry about the future. This guide walks you through what to expect from ICBC‑related acupuncture care in Coquitlam & Vancouver with Ryu Clinic, so you can take the next step with clarity and confidence.

## After a car accident: what you may feel

In the first 24–72 hours after a collision, some people feel very sore right away while others notice only mild stiffness or even nothing at all. Common areas that react after an accident include the neck, shoulders, upper back, lower back and hips, and headaches or changes in sleep are also very frequent. It is also possible for pain, stiffness or dizziness to appear days or even weeks later, a pattern known as delayed onset pain.

Emotionally, it is common to experience shock, anxiety, irritability or trouble concentrating after a motor vehicle accident. You may be replaying the crash in your mind, feeling nervous about driving again or worrying about how your symptoms will affect work and family life. When you live in the Tri‑Cities or Greater Vancouver area and depend on your car or commute, these concerns can add an extra layer of stress on top of physical pain.

### Typical symptom patterns

Many ICBC patients describe waking up with a stiff neck and difficulty turning their head fully to check blind spots. Others feel a band of tension across the upper back and shoulders, or a heavy, tight sensation at the base of the skull that turns into a headache as the day goes on. Lower back pain is also common, especially after sitting, driving or standing for longer periods, and some people notice aching or heaviness into the hips or buttocks.

Sleep is often affected too. You may find it harder to fall asleep, wake during the night because of pain or notice that you are more tired than usual during the day. All of these patterns are signals that your body and nervous system are still processing the impact of the accident and may benefit from a structured recovery plan.

## Why early assessment matters

The first weeks after a car accident are when your body is trying to decide whether this injury will heal and calm down, or settle into a long‑term pattern. If muscles stay in protective guarding, joints remain stiff and your sleep continues to be disrupted, your nervous system can start to treat this new level of pain as the “new normal.” An early assessment helps interrupt that process before it becomes entrenched.

During a proper evaluation, the clinician looks at which structures seem involved: muscles and fascia, joints, ligaments and, in some cases, nerve irritation. The goal is to understand not only where you hurt, but how you move, how you sleep and what your day actually looks like. Catching problems early often means you need fewer total visits, recover faster and get back to your usual activities in Coquitlam & Vancouver with more confidence.

### When to seek urgent medical care first

There are also times when acupuncture should not be your first stop. Red‑flag symptoms such as a sudden severe headache, vision changes, confusion, chest pain, shortness of breath, loss of consciousness or weakness need urgent medical attention. New loss of bladder or bowel control or numbness in the groin area can signal a serious neurological issue and also require immediate emergency care.

If you are not sure whether your situation is urgent, it is always better to err on the side of caution and see a doctor or visit an emergency department first. After serious conditions are ruled out and any acute medical issues are stabilised, acupuncture at Ryu Clinic can become part of your ongoing ICBC recovery plan in Coquitlam & Vancouver.

## How Ryu Clinic supports ICBC patients

At Ryu Clinic, your ICBC visit starts with a one‑on‑one assessment that covers the accident itself, your current symptoms, your work and home demands and any previous injuries or conditions. The conversation is not only about where it hurts today; it is also about what you need your body to do in the coming weeks and months.

Acupuncture is then used within a clear framework: reduce pain, calm an overactive nervous system and improve movement in key areas like the neck, shoulders, back and hips. Because Ryu Clinic works within Momentum Therapeutics in Coquitlam and Regen Recovery in Vancouver, you are in environments where physiotherapy, massage and other services are also available when appropriate. That makes it easier to integrate acupuncture with other rehabilitation therapies as needed rather than treating each service in isolation.

### What happens in a typical treatment plan

Most ICBC patients move through a few broad phases, although the exact timing is always personalised. In the first phase, the focus is on calming pain and irritation, improving sleep and helping you feel safer and more comfortable in your body. Sessions may be more frequent at this stage, for example once or twice a week, especially in the first few weeks after the accident.

In the second phase, attention shifts to restoring mobility and function: turning your head more freely, sitting and standing with less pain, and returning to basic work and home tasks. Acupuncture continues, often combined with simple movement or posture strategies you can use between visits. In the third phase, visits are spaced out as your symptoms stabilise, and the focus becomes preventing flare‑ups and supporting your full return to driving, exercise and other activities you enjoy.

## ICBC coverage and what you need to prepare

If you have an active ICBC claim, there is usually a set number of pre‑approved sessions for acupuncture and other therapies within a certain time window after the accident. In many cases you do not need a separate doctor’s referral to start acupuncture, although there can be exceptions depending on your situation and other care you are receiving.

For your first ICBC‑related visit at Ryu Clinic, it is very helpful to bring your claim number, the date of the accident, photo ID and a list of any medications you are taking. If you are already seeing a family doctor, physiotherapist, chiropractor or other provider, bring that information as well so your clinician can understand the full picture. With these details, the clinic can confirm billing arrangements and make sure your treatments are properly recorded under your claim.

### How to keep records that help your case

Keeping simple records on your side can also support both your recovery and your ICBC file. A basic pain diary—jotting down when symptoms are better or worse and which activities aggravate your pain—gives valuable insight into how your body is responding over time. It makes it easier to adjust your treatment and lifestyle to move in the right direction.

If you have imaging reports such as X‑rays or MRIs, or letters from your doctor or other therapists, store them in one place and bring copies when you come in. At each Ryu Clinic visit, taking one minute to summarise what changed since last time (better, worse, same; what you did differently) helps your practitioner fine‑tune acupuncture treatments within your ICBC coverage window.

## How to book in Coquitlam & Vancouver

Ryu Clinic sees ICBC patients at two convenient locations: Momentum Therapeutics in Coquitlam and Regen Recovery in Vancouver. If you live or work in the Tri‑Cities, the Coquitlam location is often the easiest option, while patients from Vancouver, Burnaby or Surrey frequently choose the Vancouver site.

You can book online through JaneApp for each location, choosing a time and leaving a note that you are coming in under an ICBC claim. The Contact page on ryu.clinic lists addresses, directions and parking information for both clinics, along with phone numbers if you prefer to talk through your situation before booking. At your first appointment, the aim is simple: understand what the accident did to your body, begin reducing pain and stiffness, and map out a clear, realistic plan to help you return to the work, driving, exercise and daily life that matter most to you in Coquitlam & Vancouver.
