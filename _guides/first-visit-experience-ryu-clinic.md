Walking into a new clinic for the first time can feel intimidating, especially if you've never tried acupuncture before. You might be wondering what to expect, how long it will take, whether it will hurt, and if it will actually help. This guide walks you through your first visit at Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam or Vancouver, step by step, so you know exactly what's coming and can arrive feeling prepared and confident.

## Before you arrive

**Choosing your location**: Ryu Clinic has two locations—Momentum Therapeutics in Coquitlam and Regen Recovery in Vancouver. If you live or work in the Tri-Cities, Coquitlam is often the most convenient option. If you're based in Vancouver, Burnaby, or the downtown core, the Vancouver location may be easier to reach. Both clinics offer the same high standard of care, so choose the one that fits your schedule and commute.

**What to bring**: If you have any imaging reports (X-rays, MRIs, ultrasounds), bring them along or have digital copies available. A list of medications you're currently taking is also helpful, as is any information about previous treatments you've tried. If you're coming in for an ICBC claim, bring your claim number and the date of your accident. If you're using extended health benefits, bring your insurance card or policy information.

**What to wear**: Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that allows easy access to the areas being treated. For example, if you're coming in for neck and shoulder pain, a shirt with sleeves that can be rolled up is ideal. For lower back or hip pain, pants that can be rolled up above the knee are helpful. You won't need to fully undress—acupuncture can be performed with most of your clothing on.

**Filling out intake forms**: Some clinics offer the option to complete intake forms online before your visit, which can save time when you arrive. If you prefer to fill them out on-site, plan to arrive a few minutes early. The forms will ask about your current symptoms, health history, medications, and any conditions or concerns you want to address.

## Setting your goals

Before your first visit, it's helpful to think about what you want to get out of treatment. What bothers you most right now—pain, poor sleep, stress, digestive issues, low energy? Are there specific activities you want to get back to, like running, playing with your kids, or sitting through a workday without discomfort? Are there any fears or concerns about acupuncture you'd like to discuss?

There are no wrong answers, and you don't need to have everything figured out. Your practitioner will help you clarify your goals during the conversation, but having a general sense of what matters most to you will make the first visit more productive.

## History, assessment and conversation

Your first visit begins with a conversation. Your practitioner will review your intake form and ask follow-up questions to better understand your situation. This isn't a rushed, checklist-style interview—it's a collaborative discussion where you have space to explain what's going on in your own words.

You'll talk about the history of your problem: when it started, what you think might have caused it, what makes it better or worse, and what you've already tried. You'll also discuss your daily routine, work demands, stress levels, sleep quality, and any other health concerns that might be connected to your main issue.

Next comes a basic physical assessment. Depending on your symptoms, this might include observing your posture, checking your range of motion, palpating (gently pressing on) areas of pain or tension, and performing simple movement tests. The goal is to understand not just where you hurt, but how you move, where you hold tension, and what patterns might be contributing to your symptoms.

After the assessment, your practitioner will explain their working hypothesis in plain language—what seems to be going on and why. This isn't about using complicated medical jargon; it's about helping you understand your body and the factors that are contributing to your pain or discomfort.

## Creating a treatment plan together

Based on the conversation and assessment, your practitioner will outline a treatment plan tailored to your situation. This plan will include short-term goals (like reducing pain, improving sleep, or making movement easier) and medium-term goals (like returning to specific activities, reducing the frequency of flare-ups, or building resilience against stress).

You'll also discuss how often you should come in and how many initial visits are recommended. For acute issues, you might need just a few sessions. For chronic or complex conditions, a longer series of treatments may be necessary. Your practitioner will be honest about what's realistic and will adjust the plan as you go based on how your body responds.

Progress will be measured in concrete ways—pain scales, specific tasks you can or can't do, sleep quality, energy levels, and your ability to participate in work, exercise, and daily life. This makes it easier to track improvement and adjust treatment as needed.

## Your first acupuncture treatment

Once the plan is in place, you'll move into the treatment room. The room is designed to be calm and comfortable, with soft lighting, gentle music, and privacy. You'll either lie on a treatment table or sit in a comfortable position, depending on the areas being treated.

Before starting, your practitioner will explain what to expect from the needles. Acupuncture needles are extremely thin—about the width of a human hair—and most people are surprised by how gentle the sensation is. You might feel a brief pinch, a dull ache, or a tingling sensation when a needle reaches a tight or sensitive area, but it's usually mild and fades quickly.

The typical treatment flow involves placing needles in specific points on your body, then allowing you to rest quietly for 15 to 25 minutes while the needles do their work. During this time, many people feel deeply relaxed, and some even fall asleep. Your practitioner may also use additional techniques like heat therapy, cupping, or gentle manual therapy if appropriate for your condition.

Your first treatment usually takes longer than follow-up visits—often 60 to 75 minutes total—because it includes the initial conversation and assessment. Follow-up visits are typically 30 to 45 minutes.

## What you might feel during and after

During treatment, common sensations include warmth, heaviness, mild tingling, or a deep sense of relaxation. Some people feel a subtle shift in their pain or tension even while the needles are in place. Others don't notice much during the session but feel different afterward.

After your first treatment, you might experience mild soreness at needle sites, similar to the feeling after a deep massage. Some people feel tired or pleasantly relaxed for the rest of the day. Others notice improved sleep that night or a reduction in pain or stiffness the next morning.

Occasionally, symptoms can temporarily intensify before they improve—this is a normal part of the healing process and usually resolves within a day or two. If you have any concerns after your session, the clinic is available to answer questions and provide guidance.

## Aftercare and self-care tips

Your practitioner will give you specific aftercare instructions based on your treatment, but here are some general guidelines for the rest of the day:

- **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to support your body's healing processes.
- **Move gently**: Light walking or stretching is fine, but avoid intense exercise or heavy lifting for the rest of the day.
- **Rest if needed**: If you feel tired, honor that and give your body time to rest.
- **Avoid alcohol**: Alcohol can interfere with the effects of acupuncture, so it's best to skip it on treatment days.

You may also be given simple home strategies to support your progress between sessions—heat or cold therapy, light stretching, breathing exercises, or posture adjustments. These aren't complicated or time-consuming; they're small, practical steps that help maintain the benefits of treatment.

It's helpful to track changes in your pain, sleep, energy, and mood over the next few days. Even small improvements are worth noting, as they give you and your practitioner valuable information about how your body is responding.

## Planning your next steps

At the end of your first visit, you'll have a chance to ask any remaining questions and discuss next steps. Some people prefer to book their next few appointments before they leave, while others like to book online later once they've had time to see how they feel.

Your practitioner will check in with you at your next visit to review how your body responded to the first session. Based on that feedback, the treatment plan may be refined—adjusting the frequency of visits, focusing on different areas, or incorporating new techniques.

If questions or concerns come up between visits, Ryu Clinic is available by phone or email. You're not expected to navigate this on your own, and your practitioner is there to support you throughout the process.

Your first visit is the beginning of a partnership. The goal is not just to treat your symptoms, but to help you understand your body, feel more in control of your health, and move toward the life you want to be living—with less pain, better sleep, more energy, and greater resilience.
