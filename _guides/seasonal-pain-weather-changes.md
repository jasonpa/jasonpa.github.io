If you've ever said "I can feel the rain coming in my joints," you're not imagining it. Many people in Coquitlam and Vancouver notice that their pain—whether it's arthritis, old injuries, or chronic muscle tension—gets worse when the weather changes. While we can't control the weather (especially in rainy Vancouver), acupuncture can help your body adapt to seasonal changes and reduce weather-related pain flare-ups.

## Why weather affects pain

**Barometric pressure changes**: When atmospheric pressure drops (usually before rain or storms), the pressure inside your joints may not adjust as quickly, causing tissues to expand slightly and irritate nerves. This is why many people feel increased joint pain before a storm.

**Cold temperatures**: Cold causes muscles and connective tissues to contract and stiffen. Blood vessels also constrict, reducing circulation to joints and muscles, which can increase pain and stiffness.

**Humidity**: High humidity can increase inflammation in some people, particularly those with arthritis. Vancouver's damp climate can be especially challenging for people with weather-sensitive pain.

**Reduced activity**: In winter or during long rainy periods, people tend to move less, which can lead to stiffness and deconditioning that worsen pain.

**Vitamin D deficiency**: Less sunlight in fall and winter can lead to low vitamin D levels, which are associated with increased pain sensitivity and inflammation.

## Common seasonal pain patterns

**Arthritis flare-ups**: Joint pain and stiffness worsen in cold, damp weather. Mornings are particularly difficult.

**Old injury pain**: That ankle you sprained years ago or the shoulder you injured in a car accident starts aching when the weather changes.

**Muscle tension**: Neck, shoulder, and back muscles tighten up in cold weather, leading to increased pain and headaches.

**Fibromyalgia and chronic pain**: Many people with fibromyalgia notice that their symptoms worsen in fall and winter.

## How acupuncture helps with seasonal pain

**Regulates inflammation**: Acupuncture helps calm the inflammatory response that can be triggered by weather changes.

**Improves circulation**: By increasing blood flow to affected areas, acupuncture helps counteract the effects of cold weather on muscles and joints.

**Reduces pain sensitivity**: Acupuncture modulates how your nervous system processes pain signals, making you less reactive to weather-related triggers.

**Supports adaptation**: Regular acupuncture can help your body adapt more smoothly to seasonal transitions, reducing the severity of flare-ups.

**Boosts immune function**: Acupuncture supports overall resilience, which is important during cold and flu season.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, seasonal pain management often involves more frequent sessions during the transition periods (fall to winter, winter to spring) when flare-ups are most common, then spacing out sessions during more stable weather.

## Self-care strategies for weather-related pain

**Stay warm**: Layer clothing, use heating pads, take warm baths. Keeping your body warm helps prevent muscle tension and joint stiffness.

**Keep moving**: Even gentle movement—walking indoors, stretching, yoga—helps maintain circulation and prevent stiffness.

**Vitamin D**: Consider supplementation during fall and winter, especially in Vancouver where sunlight is limited.

**Anti-inflammatory diet**: Focus on foods that reduce inflammation—omega-3 rich fish, colorful vegetables, berries, nuts.

**Hydration**: Drink plenty of water even when it's cold. Dehydration can worsen pain.

**Preventive acupuncture**: Coming in for treatment before the weather changes (if you can predict them) can help prevent flare-ups rather than just reacting to them.

You can book online through JaneApp or call Ryu Clinic to create a seasonal pain management plan that helps you stay comfortable year-round, regardless of what Vancouver's weather throws at you.
