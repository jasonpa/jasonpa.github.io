If you live with chronic headaches or migraines, you know how much they can disrupt your life. The throbbing pain, the sensitivity to light and sound, the nausea, and the unpredictability of when the next one will hit—all of it takes a toll on your work, relationships, and quality of life. While medication can help, many people in Coquitlam and Vancouver are looking for additional options that address the root causes rather than just masking symptoms. Acupuncture offers a complementary approach that can reduce the frequency and intensity of headaches over time.

## Different types of headaches

Not all headaches are the same, and understanding what type you're dealing with can help guide treatment.

**Tension headaches** are the most common type. They feel like a tight band around your head, often accompanied by neck and shoulder tension. The pain is usually dull and constant rather than throbbing, and it can last for hours or even days. Tension headaches are often triggered by stress, poor posture, eye strain, or muscle tension in the neck and upper back.

**Migraines** are more intense and often debilitating. They typically cause throbbing pain on one side of the head, along with nausea, vomiting, and sensitivity to light, sound, or smells. Some people experience an aura before the migraine starts—visual disturbances like flashing lights or blind spots. Migraines can last anywhere from a few hours to several days and often force you to stop what you're doing and lie down in a dark, quiet room.

**Cervicogenic headaches** originate from problems in the neck. The pain usually starts at the base of the skull and radiates forward toward the forehead or temples. These headaches are often associated with neck stiffness, reduced range of motion, and pain that worsens with certain neck positions or movements. They're common in people who spend long hours at a desk or have had whiplash injuries.

**Cluster headaches** are less common but extremely painful. They occur in cyclical patterns or clusters, with intense pain around one eye or temple. Cluster headaches can wake you up at night and are often accompanied by tearing, redness, or nasal congestion on the affected side.

Understanding your headache type helps your practitioner tailor treatment to address the specific patterns and triggers involved.

## Triggers: stress, posture, sleep and digestion

Headaches rarely happen in isolation. They're usually the result of multiple factors coming together—stress, poor posture, disrupted sleep, hormonal changes, dietary triggers, or underlying muscle tension.

**Stress** is one of the most common headache triggers. When you're under chronic stress, your muscles tense up, especially in the neck, shoulders, and jaw. Your nervous system stays in a heightened state, and your blood vessels can constrict or dilate in ways that trigger pain. Stress also disrupts sleep and digestion, which can further contribute to headaches.

**Posture** plays a major role, especially for people who work at desks or use screens for long periods. Forward head posture puts enormous strain on the muscles at the base of the skull and upper neck, leading to tension headaches and cervicogenic headaches. Over time, this chronic tension can become a constant source of pain.

**Sleep** quality and quantity matter. Poor sleep, irregular sleep schedules, or sleep disorders can lower your pain threshold and make you more susceptible to headaches. For migraine sufferers, both too little and too much sleep can be triggers.

**Hormonal changes** are a common trigger for migraines in women. Many women notice that their migraines coincide with their menstrual cycle, particularly in the days leading up to their period when estrogen levels drop.

**Dietary triggers** vary from person to person but can include caffeine (both too much and withdrawal), alcohol, aged cheeses, processed meats, artificial sweeteners, and skipped meals. Dehydration is also a frequent culprit.

**Digestive issues** can contribute to headaches, especially migraines. There's a strong connection between gut health and neurological function, and many people with chronic migraines also experience digestive problems.

The good news is that acupuncture can address many of these underlying factors, not just the headache itself.

## How acupuncture can help headaches and migraines

Acupuncture has been shown in research to reduce the frequency, intensity, and duration of both tension headaches and migraines. Here's how it works:

**Muscle tension release**: Acupuncture helps release tight muscles in the neck, shoulders, and jaw that contribute to tension headaches and cervicogenic headaches. By reducing this chronic tension, the frequency of headaches often decreases.

**Nervous system regulation**: Acupuncture has a calming effect on the nervous system, helping to reduce the stress response that can trigger headaches. It can also help regulate the autonomic nervous system, which controls blood vessel dilation and constriction—a key factor in migraines.

**Pain modulation**: Acupuncture stimulates the release of endorphins and other natural pain-relieving chemicals in the brain. It also affects how pain signals are processed, which can reduce the intensity of headache pain when it does occur.

**Improved circulation**: By improving blood flow to the head and neck, acupuncture can help reduce the vascular changes that contribute to migraines and other headache types.

**Hormonal balance**: For women whose migraines are linked to their menstrual cycle, acupuncture can help regulate hormonal fluctuations and reduce the severity of cycle-related headaches.

**Better sleep**: Many people notice improved sleep quality with regular acupuncture, which in turn reduces headache frequency.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, treatment for headaches and migraines is personalized based on your specific headache type, triggers, and overall health. If your headaches are primarily stress and tension-related, treatment will focus on releasing muscle tension and calming the nervous system. If you have migraines, the approach will include strategies to reduce triggers, regulate your nervous system, and support hormonal balance if relevant.

## When to see your doctor or get imaging

While acupuncture can be very effective for chronic headaches and migraines, there are times when you should see a doctor first or seek urgent medical attention.

**Red flag symptoms** that require immediate medical evaluation include:
- Sudden, severe headache that comes on like a "thunderclap"
- Headache accompanied by fever, stiff neck, confusion, vision changes, difficulty speaking, or weakness
- Headache after a head injury
- New headache pattern in someone over 50
- Headache that progressively worsens over days or weeks
- Headache with seizures or loss of consciousness

These symptoms could indicate serious conditions like stroke, aneurysm, meningitis, or brain tumors, and they require urgent medical attention.

For chronic headaches that don't have red flag symptoms, it's still a good idea to see your family doctor for an initial evaluation, especially if:
- Your headaches are new or have changed significantly
- Over-the-counter medications aren't helping
- Headaches are interfering with your daily life
- You're not sure what type of headache you have

Your doctor can rule out underlying conditions, order imaging if needed, and work with you to create a comprehensive treatment plan. Acupuncture can then be integrated as part of that plan.

## Building a realistic care plan

Managing chronic headaches and migraines usually requires a multi-faceted approach. Acupuncture is one piece of the puzzle, but it works best when combined with other strategies:

**Identify and manage triggers**: Keep a headache diary to track when headaches occur, what you were doing, what you ate, your stress levels, and your sleep quality. Over time, patterns will emerge that can help you identify and avoid triggers.

**Address posture and ergonomics**: If your headaches are related to desk work or screen time, improving your workstation setup and taking regular breaks can make a significant difference.

**Manage stress**: Incorporate stress-reduction practices like deep breathing, meditation, gentle exercise, or time in nature. Acupuncture itself is a powerful stress-management tool.

**Prioritize sleep**: Maintain a consistent sleep schedule, create a relaxing bedtime routine, and address any sleep disorders with your doctor.

**Stay hydrated and eat regularly**: Dehydration and skipped meals are common headache triggers that are easy to address.

**Consider medication when needed**: Acupuncture doesn't have to replace medication—it can work alongside it. Many people find that with regular acupuncture, they're able to reduce their reliance on pain medication over time.

**Be patient**: Headache patterns that have been building for months or years won't resolve overnight. Most people need a series of acupuncture sessions—typically six to twelve—to see significant, lasting improvement. Sessions are usually scheduled weekly at first, then spaced out as symptoms improve.
