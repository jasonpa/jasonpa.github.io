If you've been in a car accident and are considering acupuncture as part of your ICBC recovery, you probably have questions about coverage, what to expect, and how the process works. This FAQ addresses the most common questions we hear from ICBC patients in Coquitlam and Vancouver.

## Coverage and billing

**Q: Does ICBC cover acupuncture?**  
A: Yes, ICBC typically covers acupuncture as part of your accident claim. Coverage is usually provided for a set number of sessions within a specific time window after your accident (often 12 weeks, but this can vary).

**Q: Do I need a doctor's referral?**  
A: In most cases, no. You can usually start acupuncture treatment without a separate doctor's referral. However, requirements can vary depending on your specific claim and the severity of your injuries. Check with your ICBC adjuster or the clinic when you book.

**Q: How many sessions does ICBC cover?**  
A: This varies by claim, but ICBC often approves 12-25 acupuncture sessions as part of your overall treatment plan. Your practitioner will work with you to make the most of your coverage.

**Q: Do I have to pay upfront?**  
A: At Ryu Clinic, ICBC billing is handled directly in most cases, so you don't need to pay out of pocket. Bring your claim number and accident details to your first visit.

**Q: What if I need more sessions than ICBC covers?**  
A: If you need additional treatment beyond what ICBC approves, you can discuss options with your practitioner. Some people use extended health benefits or pay privately for maintenance sessions.

## Treatment questions

**Q: How soon after my accident should I start acupuncture?**  
A: The sooner, the better. Starting treatment within the first 2-4 weeks after an accident gives you the best chance of preventing chronic pain. However, acupuncture can still be helpful even if you start later.

**Q: How often will I need to come in?**  
A: In the acute phase (first 2-4 weeks), most people benefit from 1-2 sessions per week. As you improve, sessions are spaced out to every 1-2 weeks, then as needed.

**Q: Can I combine acupuncture with physiotherapy, chiropractic, or massage?**  
A: Absolutely. In fact, combining therapies often produces better results. Ryu Clinic operates within multidisciplinary facilities, making it easy to coordinate care.

**Q: Will acupuncture hurt?**  
A: Most people are surprised by how gentle acupuncture is. The needles are very thin, and while you might feel a brief pinch or dull ache, it's usually mild. Many patients find the treatment relaxing.

**Q: How long until I feel better?**  
A: Some people notice improvement after the first session, while others need several treatments before they see significant change. Chronic or severe injuries typically take longer to resolve than recent, mild ones.

## Practical details

**Q: What should I bring to my first visit?**  
A: Bring your ICBC claim number, the date of your accident, photo ID, a list of medications you're taking, and any medical records or imaging reports you have.

**Q: What should I wear?**  
A: Wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothing that allows access to the areas being treated. You won't need to fully undress.

**Q: How long does a session take?**  
A: Your first visit will take 60-75 minutes (includes assessment and treatment). Follow-up sessions are typically 30-45 minutes.

**Q: Can I drive after treatment?**  
A: Yes, most people can drive immediately after acupuncture. Some people feel relaxed or slightly tired, so listen to your body.

**Q: What if I have more questions?**  
A: Call Ryu Clinic or book a consultation. The team is happy to answer questions and help you understand how acupuncture fits into your ICBC recovery plan.

You can book online through JaneApp for the Coquitlam or Vancouver location, or call to speak with someone directly.
