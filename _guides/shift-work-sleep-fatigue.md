Shift work—whether it's night shifts, rotating schedules, or irregular hours—can wreak havoc on your sleep, energy, digestion, and overall health. Your body's natural circadian rhythm is designed to sleep at night and be awake during the day, and when you work against that rhythm for extended periods, the consequences add up. If you're a shift worker in Coquitlam or Vancouver dealing with chronic fatigue, poor sleep, or health issues related to your schedule, acupuncture can help your body adapt and recover.

## The toll of shift work

**Circadian disruption**: Your body's internal clock regulates sleep, hormone production, digestion, and immune function. Shift work forces you to be awake when your body wants to sleep and sleep when it wants to be awake, leading to chronic misalignment.

**Poor sleep quality**: Even when you do sleep, daytime sleep is often lighter, more fragmented, and less restorative than nighttime sleep. Noise, light, and your body's natural alertness during the day all interfere with deep sleep.

**Chronic fatigue**: The combination of sleep deprivation and circadian disruption leads to persistent tiredness that doesn't improve with rest.

**Digestive problems**: Eating at irregular times and when your digestive system isn't primed to work can lead to bloating, indigestion, constipation, or diarrhea.

**Weakened immune function**: Disrupted sleep and chronic stress suppress immune function, making you more susceptible to colds, infections, and illness.

**Mood and cognitive issues**: Irritability, difficulty concentrating, memory problems, and increased risk of anxiety and depression are common among shift workers.

**Long-term health risks**: Chronic shift work is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.

## How acupuncture helps shift workers

**Regulates sleep-wake cycles**: Acupuncture can help reset your circadian rhythm and improve sleep quality, making it easier to fall asleep during the day and feel more alert during your shift.

**Reduces fatigue**: By supporting your body's energy systems and improving sleep, acupuncture helps reduce the chronic exhaustion that plagues many shift workers.

**Calms the nervous system**: Acupuncture helps shift your body out of the stressed, wired state that makes it hard to wind down after a night shift.

**Supports digestion**: By regulating your nervous system and improving gut function, acupuncture can help reduce digestive issues related to irregular eating schedules.

**Boosts immune function**: Regular acupuncture supports immune resilience, helping you stay healthier despite the stress of shift work.

**Improves mood and focus**: Many shift workers notice better emotional balance and mental clarity with acupuncture.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, treatment for shift workers is scheduled around your work schedule—including evening and weekend appointments—and focuses on helping your body adapt to the demands of non-traditional hours.

## Self-care strategies for shift workers

**Sleep hygiene**: Make your bedroom as dark and quiet as possible. Use blackout curtains, earplugs, and white noise if needed. Keep the room cool.

**Consistent sleep schedule**: Try to sleep at the same time each day, even on days off, to help stabilize your circadian rhythm.

**Strategic caffeine use**: Use caffeine early in your shift to stay alert, but avoid it in the last few hours before you plan to sleep.

**Light exposure**: Get bright light exposure during your shift (especially at the beginning) and avoid bright light before bed. Consider blue-light blocking glasses in the hours before sleep.

**Nutrition**: Eat balanced meals at regular intervals. Avoid heavy, greasy foods before bed.

**Exercise**: Regular physical activity helps improve sleep quality and energy levels, but avoid intense exercise right before bedtime.

**Acupuncture schedule**: Weekly or bi-weekly sessions can help maintain balance and prevent the cumulative effects of shift work from overwhelming your system.
