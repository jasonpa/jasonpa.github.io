At Ryu Clinic, the goal isn't just to reduce your pain score from a seven to a four. It's to help you get back to the activities that matter to you—whether that's playing with your kids, returning to your sport, sitting through a workday without discomfort, or simply sleeping through the night. This guide explains how we think about pain, function, and quality of life, and what makes our approach different.

## Looking beyond pain scores

Pain is important, and reducing it is often the first step in treatment. But pain is also just one piece of a much larger picture. Two people can have the same pain score and completely different lives. One might be able to work, exercise, and enjoy their hobbies with some discomfort, while the other might be unable to leave the house or perform basic tasks.

That's why at Ryu Clinic, we focus on function and quality of life as much as we focus on pain. The questions we ask aren't just "How much does it hurt?" but also "What can't you do because of this pain?" and "What do you want to be able to do again?"

This shift in perspective changes how treatment is designed. Instead of aiming for a specific number on a pain scale, we aim for specific milestones: being able to turn your head to check your blind spot, sleeping through the night without waking up in pain, playing a full round of golf, or getting through a workday without needing to lie down.

## Structural, functional and emotional layers

Pain is rarely just a structural problem. It's a complex experience that involves your body, your movement patterns, and your emotional and psychological state. At Ryu Clinic, we look at all three layers:

**Structural**: This is the physical side—tight muscles, restricted joints, inflammation, nerve irritation, and tissue damage. Acupuncture, manual therapy, and other techniques can address these structural issues by improving circulation, releasing tension, and supporting tissue healing.

**Functional**: Even after structural issues improve, movement patterns can remain dysfunctional. You might still brace your shoulders when you're stressed, avoid certain movements out of fear, or compensate in ways that create new problems. Treatment includes helping you restore healthy movement, rebuild strength and flexibility, and regain confidence in your body's ability to move without pain.

**Psychological and emotional**: Chronic pain affects your mood, stress levels, sleep, and sense of control. It can lead to anxiety, frustration, and a feeling of helplessness. Acupuncture has a calming effect on the nervous system, which can help reduce stress and improve emotional resilience. We also recognize that healing isn't just physical—it's about feeling safe, supported, and hopeful about the future.

By addressing all three layers, treatment becomes more comprehensive and more effective. You're not just managing symptoms; you're rebuilding your relationship with your body and your life.

## How acupuncture fits into a bigger picture

Acupuncture is a powerful tool, but it's not the only tool. At Ryu Clinic, we practice within Momentum Therapeutics in Coquitlam and Regen Recovery in Vancouver, which means you have access to a full team of healthcare providers—physiotherapists, massage therapists, kinesiologists, and other specialists—all under one roof.

This collaborative environment allows for integrated care. If your condition would benefit from combining acupuncture with physiotherapy, we can coordinate that. If you need manual therapy or exercise rehabilitation alongside acupuncture, those services are available. The goal is to give you the right combination of treatments at the right time, rather than treating each service in isolation.

We also recognize that acupuncture works best when it's part of a broader approach to health. That includes what you do between sessions—how you move, how you manage stress, how you sleep, and how you take care of yourself. Treatment isn't something that happens to you for 30 minutes a week; it's a partnership where you're actively involved in your own recovery.

## What patients often ask me

**"Why isn't my pain going away with other treatments?"**  
There are many reasons why pain persists despite treatment. Sometimes the root cause hasn't been addressed—for example, treating muscle tension without addressing the stress or posture that's causing it. Sometimes the nervous system has become sensitized, so even after tissues heal, the pain signals continue. Sometimes multiple factors are involved, and a single approach isn't enough.

Acupuncture can be effective in these situations because it works on multiple levels—calming the nervous system, improving circulation, releasing muscle tension, and addressing the whole-body patterns that sustain pain. It's also a different kind of stimulus than most conventional treatments, which means it can sometimes reach problems that other therapies haven't been able to resolve.

**"How is Traditional Chinese Medicine different from Western medicine?"**  
Western medicine tends to focus on identifying and treating specific diseases or injuries. It's excellent for acute conditions, emergencies, and situations where a clear diagnosis and targeted intervention are needed.

Traditional Chinese Medicine takes a more holistic view. It looks at patterns—how different symptoms relate to each other, how your body's systems are interacting, and what underlying imbalances might be contributing to your condition. Rather than treating symptoms in isolation, TCM aims to restore balance and support your body's natural healing processes.

In practice, the two approaches are complementary. You don't have to choose one or the other. Many of our patients use acupuncture alongside conventional medical care, and we work collaboratively with family doctors, specialists, and other healthcare providers to support your overall health.

**"Can I combine acupuncture with my current treatment?"**  
In most cases, yes. Acupuncture is safe to use alongside medications, physiotherapy, chiropractic care, massage, and other treatments. In fact, many patients find that acupuncture enhances the effectiveness of their other therapies and allows them to reduce their reliance on pain medications.

Always inform your acupuncturist about any treatments or medications you're currently using so they can tailor your care appropriately and coordinate with your other providers if needed.

**"What if I'm skeptical about acupuncture?"**  
Skepticism is completely normal, especially if you're used to more conventional approaches. You don't need to believe in acupuncture for it to work—it's not about faith or placebo. Acupuncture has measurable physiological effects on the nervous system, circulation, and muscle tension, and there's a growing body of research supporting its effectiveness for pain, stress, and other conditions.

What we ask is that you come in with an open mind, give it a fair trial, and judge the results based on how you feel and what you're able to do. If it's helping, you'll know. If it's not, we'll have an honest conversation about other options.

## What to expect over time

Healing isn't linear. Some weeks you'll feel significantly better, and other weeks you might have a flare-up or feel like you're not making progress. This is normal, and it doesn't mean treatment isn't working. What matters is the overall trend—are you able to do more with less pain? Are flare-ups less frequent or less severe? Are you sleeping better, feeling less stressed, and regaining confidence in your body?

In the early stages of treatment, the focus is usually on reducing pain and improving your immediate quality of life. As treatment progresses, the focus shifts to restoring function, building resilience, and preventing future problems. Eventually, the goal is to space out visits and transition to maintenance care or self-management, so you can sustain your progress without needing ongoing treatment.

At Ryu Clinic, we're committed to patient education and empowerment. We want you to understand what's happening in your body, why certain treatments are recommended, and what you can do to support your own recovery. You're not just a passive recipient of care—you're an active participant in your healing.

Whether you're dealing with an acute injury, chronic pain, stress, or a complex health issue, our philosophy is the same: treat the whole person, address the root causes, and help you move from pain to function to the quality of life you deserve.
