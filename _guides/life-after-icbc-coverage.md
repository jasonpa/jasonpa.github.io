Your ICBC coverage for acupuncture typically lasts for a set period after your car accident—often 12 weeks, though this varies. But what happens when that coverage ends and you're feeling better but not 100%? Or when you're concerned about pain returning? This guide explains your options for continuing care after ICBC coverage ends.

## Why you might need care after ICBC coverage

**Not fully recovered**: While you may be significantly better, some residual pain, stiffness, or vulnerability remains.

**Preventing recurrence**: Car accident injuries can flare up months or even years later if not fully resolved.

**Maintenance and prevention**: Regular acupuncture can help prevent the transition from acute to chronic pain.

**Ongoing stress**: The aftermath of an accident—dealing with insurance, vehicle repairs, work disruptions—can create ongoing stress that benefits from treatment.

## Your options after ICBC coverage ends

**Extended health benefits**: Most employer health plans cover $300-$1000 per year for acupuncture. Check your benefits and use this allocation for ongoing care.

**Private pay**: If you don't have extended health benefits, you can continue treatment by paying out of pocket. Many people find that monthly maintenance sessions are affordable and worthwhile.

**Reduced frequency**: Instead of weekly sessions, transition to every 2-4 weeks for maintenance. This is more affordable and often sufficient to maintain improvements.

**Combination approach**: Use extended health benefits for regular sessions and pay privately for additional sessions if needed.

## Transitioning from intensive to maintenance care

**Assess your progress**: Work with your practitioner to evaluate how much improvement you've made and what still needs attention.

**Identify triggers**: What activities, postures, or stressors tend to bring back your symptoms? Address these proactively.

**Create a maintenance plan**: Determine the minimum frequency of treatment needed to maintain your improvements—often monthly or every 2-3 weeks.

**Self-care strategies**: Continue stretches, exercises, and lifestyle modifications that support your recovery.

**Monitor for flare-ups**: If symptoms start to return, schedule a session before they become severe.

## Benefits of ongoing maintenance

**Prevent chronic pain**: Catching small issues before they become big problems saves time, money, and suffering in the long run.

**Better quality of life**: Staying ahead of pain allows you to work, exercise, and enjoy life without constant discomfort.

**Cost-effective**: Maintenance is usually less expensive than intensive treatment for chronic problems.

**Peace of mind**: Knowing you have ongoing support reduces anxiety about pain returning.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, many former ICBC patients transition to maintenance care using their extended health benefits or private pay. The clinic can help you create a sustainable plan that fits your budget and health needs.
