If you've been told that painful periods, mood swings, exhaustion, and sleepless nights are just "part of being a woman," you're not alone—but you also don't have to accept it as normal. Many women in Coquitlam and Vancouver are finding that acupuncture and Traditional Chinese Medicine offer a different approach, one that addresses the root patterns behind menstrual pain, PMS, fatigue, and sleep issues rather than just masking symptoms.

## Common cycle-related symptoms

For some women, the week before their period is marked by irritability, bloating, breast tenderness, and a sense of heaviness or fatigue that makes even simple tasks feel overwhelming. You might notice that you're more sensitive to stress, that your patience is shorter, or that you crave certain foods and feel hungrier than usual.

When your period starts, cramping can range from mild discomfort to severe pain that interferes with work, exercise, and daily life. Some women experience lower back pain, headaches, or digestive issues like nausea and diarrhea alongside their cramps. The pain might be sharp and stabbing, or a deep, achy pressure that radiates into your hips and thighs.

Sleep often becomes disrupted during this time. You might have trouble falling asleep, wake up frequently during the night, or feel unrested even after a full night in bed. This lack of quality sleep compounds the fatigue, making it harder to concentrate, manage stress, or maintain your usual energy levels.

Even after your period ends, it can take days to feel like yourself again. The cycle repeats month after month, and over time, this pattern can start to feel inevitable—something you just have to endure.

## How stress, sleep and hormones interact

Your menstrual cycle is influenced by a delicate balance of hormones, and that balance is easily disrupted by stress, poor sleep, and lifestyle factors. When you're under chronic stress—whether from work, family, finances, or the demands of daily life in a busy city like Vancouver—your body produces more cortisol, which can interfere with the production and regulation of estrogen and progesterone.

This hormonal disruption can lead to more painful periods, irregular cycles, heavier bleeding, and more intense PMS symptoms. It can also affect your mood, energy, and sleep quality, creating a cycle where stress worsens your symptoms, and your symptoms increase your stress.

Sleep is another critical piece. During deep sleep, your body regulates hormone production and repairs tissues. When sleep is fragmented or insufficient, your hormonal balance suffers, and you're more likely to experience pain, fatigue, and mood changes. Poor sleep also lowers your pain threshold, so cramps and headaches feel more intense.

From a Traditional Chinese Medicine perspective, these patterns are often seen as imbalances in the flow of Qi (energy) and blood, or disruptions in the relationship between the liver, spleen, and kidney systems. Rather than treating each symptom separately, TCM looks at how these systems interact and aims to restore balance across the whole body.

## Acupuncture for menstrual pain and fatigue

Acupuncture can help regulate your menstrual cycle, reduce pain, improve sleep, and support overall energy levels. Here's how it works:

**Pain relief**: Acupuncture stimulates the release of endorphins, your body's natural painkillers, and helps relax the muscles of the uterus and lower abdomen. Many women notice a significant reduction in cramping and lower back pain after a few sessions, and some are able to reduce or eliminate their reliance on pain medication.

**Cycle regulation**: By supporting hormonal balance and improving blood flow to the reproductive organs, acupuncture can help regulate irregular cycles, reduce heavy bleeding, and ease the transition between phases of your cycle. This doesn't happen overnight, but over a few months, many women find that their periods become more predictable and less disruptive.

**Sleep improvement**: Acupuncture has a calming effect on the nervous system, which can make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep. Improved sleep quality, in turn, supports better hormonal balance and reduces fatigue.

**Energy and mood support**: By addressing the underlying imbalances that contribute to fatigue and mood swings, acupuncture helps restore a sense of vitality and emotional stability. You may notice that you feel more resilient, less irritable, and better able to handle the demands of your day.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, treatment plans for women's health are personalized based on your specific symptoms, cycle patterns, and overall health. If you're dealing with severe cramps, the focus might be on pain relief and muscle relaxation. If irregular cycles or PMS are your main concerns, treatment will aim to regulate your hormones and support your liver and spleen systems in TCM terms.

## Creating a safe and comfortable space

Talking about menstrual pain, hormonal symptoms, and intimate health concerns can feel vulnerable, especially if you've had experiences where your symptoms were dismissed or minimized. At Ryu Clinic, the goal is to create a space where you feel heard, respected, and supported.

Your practitioner will take time to understand your full health picture—not just your menstrual symptoms, but also your stress levels, sleep patterns, diet, work demands, and emotional well-being. This conversation is collaborative, and you're encouraged to share as much or as little as you're comfortable with.

For Korean-speaking patients, consultations can be conducted in Korean, which can make it easier to discuss sensitive topics and ensure that nothing is lost in translation. Privacy is a priority, and all conversations and treatments are conducted in a confidential, judgment-free environment.

## Preview the practitioner: common questions about women's health and acupuncture

**Is acupuncture safe for menstrual issues?**  
Yes. Acupuncture has been used for centuries to support women's health, and modern research supports its effectiveness for menstrual pain, PMS, and cycle regulation. It's a gentle, natural approach with minimal side effects, and it can be used alongside other treatments or medications if needed.

**Will you understand my concerns?**  
Absolutely. Women's health is a core area of focus in Traditional Chinese Medicine, and your practitioner has experience working with a wide range of menstrual and hormonal concerns. Whether you're dealing with severe cramps, irregular cycles, fertility challenges, or perimenopausal symptoms, your experience will be taken seriously.

**How private is the treatment?**  
Very. Treatment rooms are private, and all health information is kept confidential. You'll never be rushed, and you're in control of what you share and how treatment proceeds.

**How many sessions will I need?**  
For menstrual pain and PMS, many women start to notice improvements within three to four sessions, but lasting change often requires a series of treatments over a few menstrual cycles. Your practitioner will work with you to create a realistic plan based on your symptoms and goals.

**Can I come during my period?**  
Yes. In fact, receiving acupuncture during your period can be particularly effective for pain relief. Some women prefer to schedule sessions in the week leading up to their period to help prevent symptoms, while others come during their period for immediate relief. Your practitioner can help you determine the best timing for your situation.

## Planning care across your cycle

One of the strengths of acupuncture for women's health is that treatment can be tailored to different phases of your menstrual cycle. In the week or two before your period, sessions might focus on calming the nervous system, supporting liver function, and preventing the buildup of tension and irritability. During your period, treatment can target pain relief and blood flow. After your period, the focus might shift to rebuilding energy and supporting overall vitality.

This cyclical approach recognizes that your body's needs change throughout the month, and it allows treatment to work with your natural rhythms rather than against them.
