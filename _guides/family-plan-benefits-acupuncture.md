If you have a family extended health plan, each family member typically has their own allocation of acupuncture benefits. This means your household may have significantly more coverage than you realize. Here's how to make the most of family plan benefits at Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver.

## How family plans work

**Individual allocations**: Each covered family member (you, your spouse, your children) usually has their own annual limit for acupuncture—often $300-$1000 per person.

**Total family coverage**: A family of four might have $2000-$4000 in total acupuncture coverage per year.

**Age limits**: Children are typically covered until age 18-25, depending on student status and your specific plan.

**Separate tracking**: Each person's usage is tracked separately, so one person using their full allocation doesn't affect others.

## Who can benefit from acupuncture

**Adults**: Chronic pain, stress, headaches, digestive issues, sleep problems, sports injuries, car accident recovery.

**Teenagers**: Sports injuries, stress and anxiety, menstrual pain, headaches, acne.

**Children**: Some plans cover acupuncture for children. It can help with allergies, digestive issues, sleep problems, and anxiety. Pediatric acupuncture uses very gentle techniques.

## Maximizing family benefits

**Coordinate care**: If multiple family members need treatment, schedule appointments on the same day to save time.

**Use all allocations**: Don't let benefits go unused. Even if one person doesn't need regular treatment, they might benefit from occasional sessions for stress management or injury prevention.

**Year-end planning**: In November-December, check how much coverage each family member has left and book sessions to use it before it resets.

**Preventive care**: Use benefits for maintenance and prevention, not just when problems arise.

**Share strategies**: If one family member finds acupuncture helpful, others might benefit too.

## Booking for families at Ryu Clinic

**Flexible scheduling**: Book multiple family members back-to-back or at the same time (if two practitioners are available).

**Insurance coordination**: Ryu Clinic can help track each family member's benefits and ensure claims are submitted correctly.

**Age-appropriate care**: Treatment is tailored to each person's age, condition, and comfort level.

You can book online through JaneApp or call Ryu Clinic to discuss how your family can make the most of your extended health benefits for acupuncture.
