Most people first try acupuncture when they're in pain or dealing with a specific problem. But once you've experienced relief, you might wonder: should I keep coming back even when I feel better? The answer for many people is yes. Regular maintenance acupuncture—typically once a month or every few weeks—can help prevent problems from returning and support long-term health and resilience.

## What maintenance acupuncture means

**Preventive care**: Instead of waiting for pain or symptoms to return, you come in regularly to maintain the improvements you've made and catch small issues before they become big problems.

**Frequency**: Most people find that monthly sessions are enough to maintain benefits, though some prefer every 2-3 weeks during high-stress periods or every 6-8 weeks during more stable times.

**Focus**: Maintenance sessions address minor tension, stress, sleep issues, and seasonal changes before they escalate into chronic problems.

## Who benefits most from maintenance care

**People with chronic conditions**: If you have arthritis, fibromyalgia, migraines, or other ongoing conditions, regular acupuncture can help keep symptoms manageable and reduce flare-up frequency.

**High-stress jobs**: If your work is demanding—physically, mentally, or emotionally—monthly acupuncture can help you manage stress and prevent burnout.

**Athletes and active adults**: Regular sessions support recovery, reduce injury risk, and help you maintain performance.

**People with a history of recurring pain**: If your back, neck, or shoulder pain tends to come back every few months, maintenance care can break that cycle.

**Aging well**: As you get older, regular acupuncture can help manage age-related aches, support joint health, and maintain mobility.

## Benefits of regular maintenance

**Prevent recurrence**: Catching tension and imbalances early prevents them from developing into full-blown pain episodes.

**Better stress management**: Regular nervous system support helps you handle life's challenges with more resilience.

**Improved sleep**: Ongoing treatment helps maintain healthy sleep patterns.

**Seasonal support**: Monthly sessions help your body adapt to seasonal changes that might otherwise trigger pain or illness.

**Cost-effective**: Preventing problems is often less expensive (and less disruptive to your life) than treating them after they've become severe.

## Using your extended health benefits

**Annual planning**: If your plan covers $500-$1000 per year, that's enough for 8-12 maintenance sessions.

**Strategic scheduling**: Book sessions in advance to ensure you use your full allocation before it resets.

**Combine with other benefits**: Use acupuncture benefits for maintenance while saving physiotherapy or massage benefits for acute issues.

**Track your usage**: Keep a record of how many sessions you've used and how much coverage remains.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, many patients transition from intensive treatment to monthly maintenance once their initial problem has resolved. This approach helps them stay healthy, active, and pain-free long-term.

You can book online through JaneApp or call to set up a maintenance schedule that works for your health goals and insurance coverage.
