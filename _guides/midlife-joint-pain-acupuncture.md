If you're in your 40s, 50s, or 60s and noticing that your joints aren't what they used to be—morning stiffness, aching knees, sore hands, or shoulders that protest when you reach overhead—you're not alone. Joint pain and stiffness are common as we age, but they don't have to limit your life. Acupuncture offers a natural, drug-free way to manage joint pain, reduce inflammation, and maintain mobility as you age.

## Why joints hurt more as we age

**Cartilage wear**: Over decades of use, the cartilage that cushions your joints gradually wears down. This is the basis of osteoarthritis, the most common form of joint disease. As cartilage thins, bones can rub together, causing pain, inflammation, and stiffness.

**Inflammation**: Chronic low-grade inflammation increases with age and contributes to joint pain. In some cases, this inflammation is part of an autoimmune condition like rheumatoid arthritis.

**Reduced lubrication**: Synovial fluid, which lubricates your joints, decreases with age. This makes joints feel stiff and creaky, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity.

**Muscle weakness**: As we age, we naturally lose muscle mass (sarcopenia). Weaker muscles provide less support for joints, increasing stress on cartilage and ligaments.

**Previous injuries**: Old injuries—sports injuries, car accidents, falls—can come back to haunt you decades later as the affected joints age faster than others.

## Common patterns of midlife joint pain

**Knee pain**: Climbing stairs, getting up from a chair, or walking on uneven terrain becomes uncomfortable. The pain might be sharp, aching, or accompanied by a grinding sensation.

**Hip pain**: Deep aching in the hip or groin, especially after walking, standing, or lying on that side. Hip arthritis can also cause referred pain in the thigh or knee.

**Hand and finger pain**: Stiffness in the morning, difficulty gripping or opening jars, swelling in the finger joints. This is common in both osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.

**Shoulder pain**: Difficulty reaching overhead, behind your back, or across your body. Rotator cuff issues and arthritis in the shoulder joint are common culprits.

**Morning stiffness**: Waking up feeling like the Tin Man—stiff, achy, and needing 15-30 minutes (or longer) to loosen up.

## How acupuncture helps joint pain

**Reduces inflammation**: Acupuncture has anti-inflammatory effects that can help calm irritated joints and reduce swelling.

**Improves circulation**: Better blood flow to joints supports healing and helps clear away inflammatory byproducts.

**Pain relief**: Acupuncture modulates pain signals and stimulates natural pain-relieving chemicals, reducing discomfort without medication.

**Increases range of motion**: By releasing muscle tension around joints and reducing inflammation, acupuncture can improve flexibility and movement.

**Supports overall vitality**: Many people notice improved energy, better sleep, and reduced stress with regular acupuncture—all of which support joint health.

At Ryu Clinic in Coquitlam and Vancouver, treatment for midlife joint pain is personalized based on which joints are affected, the severity of your symptoms, and your overall health. The goal is to reduce pain, maintain mobility, and help you stay active and independent as you age.

## Combining acupuncture with other strategies

**Stay active**: Gentle, regular movement—walking, swimming, yoga, tai chi—keeps joints mobile and muscles strong. Acupuncture can reduce pain enough to make exercise more comfortable.

**Maintain a healthy weight**: Extra weight puts more stress on weight-bearing joints like knees and hips.

**Anti-inflammatory diet**: Foods rich in omega-3s, antioxidants, and fiber can help reduce systemic inflammation.

**Strength training**: Building muscle around joints provides better support and reduces stress on cartilage.

**Physical therapy**: If needed, a physiotherapist can teach you exercises to improve joint stability and function.

**Medication when necessary**: Acupuncture doesn't have to replace medication—it can work alongside it. Many people find they can reduce their reliance on pain medication with regular acupuncture.
