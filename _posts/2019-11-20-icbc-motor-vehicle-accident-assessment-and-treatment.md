# We do Direct Billing ICBC

    1 No doctor's referral required
    2 No upfront payment required
    3 No extra charges at our clinic

# ICBC policy changed as of April 1, 2019

From April 1, 2019, the ICBC ICBC Motor Vehicle Accident (MVA) Treatment System will be changed.[^1] [^2] 

In the future, if you come to the clinic with a claim number without the cumbersome pre-processing, you can start the acupuncture treatment immediately.

Within 12 weeks of the accident, you can get 12 pre-approved ICBC traffic accident treatments for a minor accident and your expenses are covered. Of course, in case of major injuries, you can receive additional treatment through the approval process.

If you are in a car accident, please do not delay and come directly to Ryu Clinic.

It is well known that Acupuncture treatment also helps to overcome acute / chronic pain treatment and trauma. It is very encouraging that the system will be changed so that various treatments can be selected.
