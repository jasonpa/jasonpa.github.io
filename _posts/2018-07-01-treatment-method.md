# Auricular Acupuncture
The ear is a microsystem which reflects the entire body. Conditions affecting the physical, mental or emotional health of the patient can be treatable by stimulating the surface of the ear with a small seed. It is also called auricular acupuncture.

# Cupping
Cupping is a therapy designed to stimulate the flow of blood and Qi within the superficial muscles layers. It is used for many ailments including sore muscles, tension, neck pain and the common cold. In the therapy, vacuumed glass or plastic “cups” will be placed over specific areas on your body. They may be moved to an affected area or left in place.

# Moxibustion
Moxibustion is a treatment that uses an herb called mugwort. It may be burned on the handle of the needle, above the skin, directly on the skin, on salt or on a slice of ginger. This is used to “warm” acupuncture points or areas in order to quicken the healing process. We are also doing Japanese style of direct moxibustion: [North America Journal of Oriental Medicine](http://www.najom.org/)
