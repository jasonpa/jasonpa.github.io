## Biomechanisms of electric acupuncture
### Pain
2-4 HZ Beta-Endophins - Minimum of 20 minutes of stimulation time for the endogenous opiods to be produced and start releasing into the body. 

  - Pain relief starts after 20 minutes and can ramp up stronger and stronger for days.
  - 1 Treatment can last for days or weeks
  - 3-5 Treatments in a row triggers an immense increase in the production of endophines and the resulting pain relief can last weeks or months.

2-4 HZ Antiinfrlammatory - ACTH (precursor to Cortison) is released in equimolar amounts to Beta-endorphin.
