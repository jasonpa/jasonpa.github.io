# From the business
## Specialties
Our goal is to help people to reach their goal. By activating and promoting natural healing by using acupuncture, herbal medicine and more. It can not only enhance recuperative power, immunity and physical and emotional health but also improve overall function and well-being.

## History
Established in 2018.

Even when I worked as a software developer for 12 years before studying acupuncture and oriental medicine, I have been fascinated with ways to heal the body and mind and achieve a balanced healthy life. 

During shifting my career, I graduated from 2 different universities and college. After finishing school, I started JimanTreatsWell Acupuncture in 2013. I've got a top ranked Acupuncture in New Westminster in 2017 and one of the top 3 Acupuncture in Coquitlam in the same year. 

Finally, in 2018 JimanTreatsWell Acupuncture transformed into Ryu Clinic Inc. Community Acupuncture & TCM in Port Moody.
