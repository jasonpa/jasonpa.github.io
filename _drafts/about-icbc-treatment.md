On your first visit our health care professionals we’ll assess your condition and make recommendations for an injury specific treatment. If you haven’t already done so, we may refer you to a Medical Doctor who understands the complexities of motor vehicle injury’s as there may be underlying problems not clearly evident at the time of your appointment. It is important to understand that unaddressed soft tissue injuries can significantly reduce the quality of your life and create long term financial hardship for you and your family.

## See Your Doctor
This step can occur before seeing us but it’s not necessary prior to beginning treatment for soft tissue injuries. It is highly recommended that you meet with a Medical Doctor so they have a complete and thorough record of your injuries on file. Your doctor’s file will be a very important part of your claim for injury compensation.

## Talk to an Injury Lawyer
We work with some of Vancouver’s top Injury Lawyers and can make a personal introduction for you. A good injury lawyer should give you a free initial consultation. Having an experienced injury lawyer working for you will assist you in understanding the process better and answer your questions.
Your lawyer will also want you to keep a diary of expenses and other issues relating to your accident. Things like time off work, pain severity and frequency, difficulties in normal daily activities, treatment costs, and general impact on the quality of life.

## Get Cost of Treatments Covered
Although ICBC will cover a portion of your initial treatment costs, and in some cases all of them, everyone’s recovery from auto accident injuries is different. Many injury claims can take years to resolve and getting the treatments you need are critical to improving your recovery. Over time this can become a very expensive process and most people need financial help.
In many cases your lawyer will cover the costs of your treatments and will pay us directly while your claim is being settled with ICBC.
There are times when a lawyer is not in a position to pay for your treatment costs and this is why we have created the Recovery Support Program. This program has been designed to financially support your injury recovery so you don’t have to stress how you’re going to pay for it. This could represent thousands of dollars over the course of your settlement process. Services such as Massage Therapy, Physiotherapy, Chiropractic, and Active Rehab treatments critical to your injury recovery are covered under this program.
