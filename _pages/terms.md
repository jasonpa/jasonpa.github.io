                <p class="mb-8">
                    By accessing and using the services provided by Ryu Clinic Inc. ("the Clinic"), you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions. These terms apply to all patients, visitors, and users of our website and clinical services.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-clinic-dark mb-6">2. Scope of Service</h2>
                <p class="mb-8">
                    Ryu Clinic provides Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) services, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, and related therapies. Our practitioners are licensed by the <strong>CCHPBC</strong> and operate within the scope of practice defined by British Columbia provincial regulations. We do not provide emergency medical services.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-clinic-dark mb-6">3. Appointment and Cancellation Policy</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>24-Hour Notice:</strong> We require at least 24 hours' notice for the cancellation or rescheduling of an appointment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Late Cancellation Fees:</strong> Appointments cancelled with less than 24 hours' notice, or missed appointments (no-show), may be subject to a cancellation fee equivalent to the full cost of the treatment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Arrival Time:</strong> Please arrive 5-10 minutes early for your first visit to complete necessary intake forms.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-clinic-dark mb-6">4. Fees and Payment</h2>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
                    <li>Payment is due at the time of service unless otherwise arranged.</li>
                    <li><strong>Insurance:</strong> We offer direct billing to most major extended health providers and ICBC. However, patients are ultimately responsible for any fees not covered by their insurance.</li>
                    <li><strong>ICBC Claims:</strong> Patients with active ICBC claims must provide a valid claim number and date of accident. Coverage is subject to ICBC approval.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-clinic-dark mb-6">5. Professional Conduct</h2>
                <p class="mb-8">
                    The Clinic maintains a safe and respectful environment. Any form of harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate behavior toward staff or other patients will result in immediate termination of services and potential legal action.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-clinic-dark mb-6">6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                <p class="mb-8">
                    While our practitioners strive to provide the highest standard of care, results of TCM and acupuncture treatments vary by individual. The Clinic is not liable for indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of our services or website.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-clinic-dark mb-6">7. Governing Law</h2>
                <p class="mb-8">
                    These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal laws of Canada.
